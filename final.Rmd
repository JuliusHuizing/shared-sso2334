```{r}
data_path = "./data/"
birth_data = read.table(paste(data_path, "birthweight.txt", sep=""), header = TRUE)
austen_data = read.table(paste(data_path, "austen.txt", sep=""), header = TRUE)
weather_data = read.table(paste(data_path, "weather.txt", sep=""), header = TRUE)

```

### Exercise 1.1

(a) 

-   The data seems to be normally distributed as a qqplot shows a roughly straight line (see figure below)
-   using the mean() function yields a points estimate of **2913.293** for the mean weight (in grams).

```{r}
# summary(birth_data)
# check the normality of the data through a qqplot.
qqplot = qqnorm(birth_data$birthweight)
mean_point_estimate = mean(birth_data$birthweight)
```


(b) How do we do this?

```{r}
mean_point_estimate # yields 2913.293
```
