Guidelines for assignments
If you do not adhere to the rules presented here, the grader can subtract points from your grade.

For each assignment, each group submits in Canvas only one version of the assignment report in English, as a single PDF-file, which must be openable and of good quality.
The deadlines for submitting the assignments are strict.  
The page limit for each assignment is 10 pages.
Write your names and group  number on the top of the first page.
Present your work in a neat, organized manner. Structure the report and perform a spell check.
Explain/argue/comment on your answers/choices/results, but write down only what is relevant. Points will be deducted for irrelevant information in your report.
Write a succinct report: no title page; no need to copy the question, no need to copy the entire R-output of tests, give only relevant lines. But do not leave out any essentials, as your report should convince the grader that you understand the theory and can interpret the results.
Structure the R-code per (sub)question and put possible auxiliary lengthy R-code in an appendix.
Provide only relevant, reasonably sized graphs, with labeled axes and informative titles. Make sure your figures are neat and the data is well depicted. You can put two figures (or more) next to each other. Use par(mfrow=c(n,m)) to create n by m plots in one picture in R.
Use proper rounding. In most cases, 2-3 digits after the decimal point suffice. For instance, 0.015435234 → 0.015, 0.4232 → 0.42, 7e-4 = 0.0007 → 0.001.
Draw conclusions, but do not contradict your results, e.g., because they are not what you expected.
Perform model check if asked and/or relevant, comment on possible peculiarities in the data.
Groups work independently, we trust you on this, but will not tolerate cheating. Cheating results in 0 points and consequences according to UvA regulations.
As a final (informal) check: think about the kind of report you would like to read yourself.
Simulation & optimization part addition (only relevant for Assignment 2 and Assignment 3):

Add screenshots to your report of the Excel sheets that you used, including the solver window. It should clearly demonstrate what you did and found. As is also stated above, provide a concise but clear explanation.
Ensure that your Excel sheets are well-structured.

Remark. If you are sufficiently proficient with RStudio, you can use R Markdown facility within RStudio, which allows dynamic report generation from R. It combines the syntax of Markdown with embedded R code chunks and Latex code that are run so that their output can be dynamically included in the final (PDF) document. A Markdown template that you can use: template_assign.Rmd Download template_assign.Rmd (the corresponding pdf output template_assign.pdf Download template_assign.pdf). It is not mandatory to use R Markdown.
